    It is currently possible to manage a volume to an encrypted volume
    type, but that is not recommended because there is no way to supply
    an encryption key for the volume to cinder.  Un-managing a volume
    of an encrypted volume type is already prevented, and it is expected
    that management to an encrypted type will similarly be blocked in a
    future release.  This issue is being tracked as `Bug #1944577
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1944577>`_.

    **Cinder use of cgroups v1**

    This note applies to deployments that are using the cinder
    configuration option ``volume_copy_bps_limit`` in its non-default
    value (the default is 0).

    The cinder-volume service currently depends on `Linux Kernel
    Control Groups (cgroups) version 1
    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.html>`_
    to control i/o throttling during some volume-copy and image-convert
    operations.  Some Linux distributions, however, have changed to using
    `cgroup v2
    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html>`_
    by default and may have discontinued cgroups v1 support completely.
    Consult your Linux distribution's documentation for details.

    The cinder team is working on a throttling solution using cgroup
    v2, but it was not ready at the time of this release.  The solution
    is expected to be backported to a future release in the Xena series.
    This issue is being tracked as `Bug #1942203

    There is a race condition between the delete attachment and delete
    volume operations that has been observed when running cinder-csi.
    This race can leave deleted volumes stuck as attached to instances.
    The cinder team is working on a solution which is expected to be
    backported to a future release in the Xena series.  The issue is
    being tracked as `Bug #1937084
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1937084>`_.

    When the Ceph backup driver is used for the backup service,
    restoring a backup to a volume created on a non-RBD backend fails.
    The cinder team is working on a solution which is expected to be
    backported to a future release in the Xena series.  The issue is
    being tracked as `Bug #1895035
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1895035>`_.

    Creating a volume of an encrypted volume type from an image in
    the Image service (Glance) using the generic NFS driver results
    in an unusable volume.  The cinder team is working on a solution
    which is expected to be backported to a future release in the
    Xena series.  The issue is being tracked as `Bug #1888680
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1888680>`_.
